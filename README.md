## Didn't succeed with the TurnStyleServer tried - but failed - now there's no more time because of work 

Next time I will look up the state and command patterns to make a better designed protocol.

(It seems I've been making 2 protocols: a protocol for the protocol and one for the servertaks .. hmmm)

However I learned a LOT! :D

Next time will see if can do all the exercises!
